# IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP - Adaptive Trading System

## PHASE 1: TESTING & VALIDATION (This Week)
- [x] Core adaptive framework implemented
- [x] Basic regime detection working  
- [x] Adaptive indicators functional
- [x] Integration scripts created
- [ ] Test with real market data
- [ ] Validate regime detection accuracy
- [ ] Benchmark against original strategies

## PHASE 2: GRADUAL ROLLOUT (Next Week)
- [ ] Enable adaptive mode for 1 strategy (AlphaOne)
- [ ] Monitor performance vs original
- [ ] Fine-tune regime thresholds
- [ ] Add ML components (optional)
- [ ] Update daily automation

## PHASE 3: FULL DEPLOYMENT (Following Week)
- [ ] Enable for all strategies
- [ ] Multi-timeframe data integration
- [ ] Performance analytics dashboard
